The bitumen replacement market is a potential repurposing for large quantities of waste plastics. It addresses an urgent economic and environmental need for plastic recycling as well as the transportation industry. With 4-5% replacement of bitumen, this market has the potential to consume 1 million tons of waste plastics out of the 26 million tons that go to landfills in the US. Also, the study goal is aligned with the global emphasis on enhancing transportation infrastructure sustainability. Moreover, asphalt pavements are 100% recyclable; therefore, plastic waste will remain in a recycling circular loop. Plastic waste, from landfill destined municipal solid waste (MSW), will be formulated for incorporation in bitumen that meets specified rheological and mechanical performance. Through manipulation of the chemical and molecular composition of waste plastics, current challenges, including sorting and processing of different plastics, storage instability and compatibility between bitumen and various plastics will be addressed.
The objectives of this study are as follows:
Develop compatibility and blending methodology of various plastic waste plastic for bitumen modification.
Investigate the suitability of plastic types and mixed plastics for modifying bitumen.
Determine the storage stability of plastic waste modified bitumen.
Perform chemical and rheological characterization of plastic-modified bitumen.
Quantify environmental benefits using life cycle assessment (LCA) for plastic-modified bitumen."

For example, polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now found in many landfills and cause great concerns to owners and operators. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is game-changing treatment technology that could provide superior treatment with better economics. The Deshusses’ lab is leading the US with its new SCWO technology. It is well positioned to evaluate this technology at a technology readiness level (TRL7) leveraging past and existing funding. The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of using SCWO at landfills in the US.
Supporting objectives to reach these goals are to:
Demonstrate treatment of representative landfill leachates, condensates and concentrated liquids such as leachate reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate in our pilot 1 ton/day SCWO system with specific focus on PFAS and emerging contaminants.
Conduct a detailed economic analysis of using SCWO at landfills at larger scale. This will include early assessment of scale and SCWO system throughout. If this assessment indicates that concentration of leachates and condensates (e.g., using reverse osmosis) followed by SCWO is the preferred route for treatment, the project will focus on treatment of concentrated liquids such as RO leachate concentrates.
Explore treatment synergies (e.g., hazardous wastes, PFAS contaminated sludge, selected organic wastes TBD with EREF) that may be co-treated with leachate/condensate or RO concentrates and that may affect the economic outcome."

There is an urgent need to develop data describing the effectiveness of landfill liner materials to contain PFAS. Past research, gives us every reason to expect that the landfill liners used today are highly effective in containing PFAS. Without data, however, proponents can make a strong argument that landfills with PFAS in leachate pose a significant threat.
Within this context, the two primary objectives of proposed study are:
Characterize the transport properties of PFAS in typical materials used for Subtitle composite liners.
Conduct bench-scale composite liner experiments coupled with modeling predictions to evaluate transport of PFAS in composite liners, and draw authoritative conclusions regarding the efficacy of Subtitle D liners to contain PFAS in MSW leachate."

In our previous research, we developed a material design guide and specification that owners can use for design or bidding. There are however, important limitations to the  developed guide in that it: (1) does not address repair strategies and repair material selection, (2) is limited to portland cement concrete, (3) does not cover the use of unconventional concretes such as iron aggregate and epoxy matrix, (4) applies to slabs with a minimum of 6-inch thickness and does not cover thin precast and prestressed overlays, and (5) does not include provisions for the use chemical or mineral admixtures that can increase the acid resistance of concrete.

Thus, there is a need for pre-treatment alternatives to remove PFAS from landfill leachate and enable landfill operators to continue to sustainably manage landfill leachate via current disposal methods. The team seeks to adapt the technology of applying cationic polymer coagulants currently used in wastewater and drinking water treatment to sequester PFAS for integration with common landfill leachate pre-treatment practices to remove PFAS from leachate.
The specific objectives of the proposed work are:
To demonstrate the removal of PFAS from landfill leachate through the application of select cationic polymers.

While multifamily recycling research strongly emphasizes the role of convenience in increasing recycling, once such structural characteristics are in place there is a need to look to behavioral factors to see further gains. While social norm-based interventions are well-studied in the energy field, there is less work in this area for recycling research, highlighting an important gap.
The objectives of the research are to:
Assess the effectiveness of social-norm based interventions on household recycling behavior in multifamily buildings

Conventional co-AD, in which two distinct waste streams are digested together (e.g., food waste and wastewater solids), generates methane gas (CH4). However, the low market value of CH4 ($160/ton) translates into a long return on initial capital investment and limits revenue generation that could help offset maintenance and operating costs. Shutting down the biological pathways to CH4 production in co-AD (via inhibition of methanogenesis) can result in the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) without compromising solids destruction goals. For example, research at NCSU has shown that increasing grease interceptor waste (GIW) loading beyond certain thresholds during co-AD with waste activated sludge can stop CH4 production and lead to generation of the VFAs acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids. These VFAs have current market values in the range of $525 (acetic acid) to $6,000 (valeric acid) per ton and are therefore significantly more valuable than CH4. While the knowledge of how to operate co-AD to generate VFAs exists, the primary challenge facing implementation of this approach is the lack of effective methods to separate and recover VFAs from co-AD.
The overall goal of the proposed research is to demonstrate the technical feasibility of recovering VFAs from co-AD using electrochemical methods. To accomplish this overall goal, the following specific objectives will be pursued:
To determine how the composition of organic-rich, solid waste mixtures impacts VFA production during co-AD.
To measure VFA recovery efficiencies and rates using an electrochemical-based separation process.
To build and test a scalable electrochemical cell (e-cell) design that will be used to validate VFA recovery from co-AD effluents."

Solidification/stabilization (S/S) using combinations of additives such as lime, portland cement, and coal combustion residuals (e.g. fly ash) can provide a final disposal option. The solidified waste can be landfilled, where encapsulation of the contaminants prevents leaching into landfill leachate collection systems and ground water. Successful mixture designs will likely depend on the composition, pH, and contaminants of concern in the liquid wastes, and a strategy for S/S of wastewater across industries is needed. Further, the success of a S/S strategy to prevent leaching of contaminants is often approached using methods that do not effectively evaluate the chemical stability of solidified materials, especially when several S/S methods are to be compared, which hinders the progress of new developments in material designs.
The overall goal of this project is to develop streamlined processes for solidifying brines and testing the solidified materials that are rapid, cost-effective, relevant, accessible and user-friendly for industry researchers. The objectives are:
To develop a method to efficiently design mixtures to solidify industrial wastewater and leachates using additives (fly ash, lime, portland cement).
To develop and test a better method for leaching assessment of monolithic specimens that also captures hydraulic conductivity (permeability), a crucial encapsulation physical property."

The key to economically feasible AD of food wastes is maintaining high and stable methane yields under various loading and substrate conditions. However, the interactions between substrate variability (different food wastes, loading) and microbial community adaptations are not known, even though these directly impact start-up, loading rates, methane yields and process resilience and resistance. This is an important issue in full scale operation, since the collected food waste can vary in type, strength and characteristics on a seasonal, daily or per load basis.

Elevated temperatures have a number of deleterious effects that are well known to landfill owners. Consequently, elevated temperature landfills often require increased monitoring and management. In recent work supported by EREF, the researchers developed a model of heat accumulation in a landfill. The objective of the model was to help identify and mathematically describe all sources of heat input, generation and loss in a typical Subtitle D landfill. The model simulations identified several reactions that contribute significant heat to landfills including the hydration and carbonation of calcium-containing wastes (e.g., ash) and aluminum corrosion. Model predictions however, were based on information adopted from the literature for systems other than landfills. In addition to MSW, many landfills receive non-hazardous industrial wastes including ash from both coal and MSW combustion, ash used to solidify liquid wastes, auto shredder residue (ASR) that contains Al and Fe, and perhaps other Al-containing wastes. Methods are needed to measure the heat production potential of such wastes under landfill-relevant conditions and to use the resulting heat production data to evaluate the quantity of a given waste that can be disposed without the accumulation of unacceptable heat.

However, Method 21 is time consuming and expensive, and whole landfill model input uncertainties and spatio-temporal variations can lead to considerable errors compared to actual emissions. A tracer correlation method (TCM), which represents the current state-of-the-art, can perform measurements under certain conditions, but it has critical limitations that have prevented its widespread adoption. The waste management industry therefore needs affordable and effective empirical methods to directly test and validate, or replace, computational models and Method 21 for whole-landfill and surface emission monitoring.

The ideal model is a circularized food system that eliminates waste by returning nutrients to agricultural soils while minimizing water and energy use. Movement toward organic waste recovery and nutrient recycling presents emergent risks that must be included in planning to ensure the safety of a more circular food system.
Different strategies for waste organics recovery produce materials of varying quality and energy content. The market value and social acceptance of the residuals depend on both the quality of the product, which is related to input material quality and processing, and the end-users’ trust in the product. With more organic material collected from mixed waste streams there is the possibility for new – unforeseen, unregulated and emergent – risks to arise.
The primary goal of this research is to identify the emergent risks associated with more cyclical food systems and to identify appropriate management procedures, policies and programs to reduce these risks. The objectives are:

Leachates from these types of waste contain cations at concentrations of a few orders of magnitude higher than typical MSW leachate and can significantly affect the performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). GCLs are hydraulic barrier systems that have a very low hydraulic conductivity to prevent contamination of the surrounding ground water. The aggressive characteristics (e.g. high total dissolved solids, such as K+, Na+, Mg2+ Ca2+ and NH4+ of the MSW-I landfill leachates may alter the bentonite fabric and lead to unacceptable increase in hydraulic conductivity. To resist these high ionic strength leachates, polymer-modified bentonites (PMBs) GCLs containing a blend of Na-B and various polymers have been introduced in recent years; these GCLs are referred to as second generation GCLs. The performance data and design criteria from the first generation GCLs cannot be directly applied to the second generation of GCLs, as the first generation of GCLs cannot manage the increased contaminants in the leachate. To date, only a limited number of studies have been performed on polymer modified GCLs, and the effects of the aggressive leachates on the performance and design of the second generation GCLs have not been well understood.
The first objective of this study is to develop new alternative index tests, or criteria to predict the long-term hydraulic performance of the second generation GCLs.

Landfill leachate increasingly requires pre-treatment because it contains high levels of refractory organic matter (ROM) and ammonia that could impact WWTP operations. ROM (i.e. humic- and fulvic-like substances) in leachate reduces the effectiveness of UV disinfection. As a result, WWTPs increasingly refuse to accept landfill leachate, pressuring landfill owners to explore costlier treatment alternatives.
Thus, understanding the sources of ROM and exploration of alternatives to reduce its presence in leachates are needed. Concurrent with the difficulty in treating leachate in WWTPs, the diversion of food waste from landfills is increasing. This diversion is motivated by several factors including responses to policies banning food waste disposal, reducing landfill methane emissions, and more efficient recovery and utilization of methane from anaerobic digesters. As the composition of the waste stream changes, changes to leachate quality can be expected.
The objectives of the study are:
To determine the effect of removing food waste from municipal solid waste (MSW) on leachate quality during waste decomposition under simulated landfill conditions
To characterize the compounds/moieties that absorb UV at 254 nm in samples of leachate produced in systems with and without food waste
It is hypothesized that food waste diversion will result in reduced ammonia and ROM since food waste is readily degradable and more easily solubilized, when compared to other MSW organics."

The specific research objectives are to (1) optimize oxyanion immobilization in concentrated FGD brine S/S with BCFA through a combination of chemical reduction and chemical incorporation in cement minerals, (2) evaluate BCFA S/S conditions including temperature, pH, CaO content, temperature, and reactive Al2O3 that promote chemical incorporation of oxyanions and Cl- in the AFm phase, (3) evaluate the stability of immobilized oxyanions and Cl- in short- and long-term leaching tests under varied conditions, and (4) optimize the impact of S/S solid mineralogy on oxyanion and Cl- stabilization over the short- and long-term.

The proposed project will “make up for lost time (and space)” by filling this three-decade-old data gap. In so doing the project team will strengthen the path for the waste management industry to be a key facilitator of and participant in large-scale reuse and recycling of NHIW.
Key research objectives are:
To yield robust, up-to-date estimates of quantities and physiochemical properties of NHIW based on a sector-by-sector analysis of 14 major manufacturing sectors in the US;
To catalog demonstrated and newly identified material substitution and beneficial use pathways for high-tonnage NHIW categories within existing landfill footprints (as alternative cover and construction fill) and beyond; and
To codify methods for regular revision and update of NHIW estimates based on indirect data (i.e. other than directly-reported data on NHIW generation)."

Given the interrelated nature of solid waste management (SWM) systems, any new policies or strategies must be fully analyzed to ensure that overall solid waste system performance is not negatively affected. This is especially true considering how waste generation, composition, the energy system, and policies are changing.
The Solid Waste Optimization Life-cycle Framework (SWOLF) is a life-cycle assessment (LCA) optimization tool developed for integrated analysis of SWM systems as part of a previous EREF grant (go.ncsu.edu/SWOLF). SWOLF consists of state-of-the-art life-cycle process models for solid waste collection, recycling, landfilling, composting, anaerobic digestion (AD), waste-to-energy (WTE), and gasification that will uniquely facilitate integrated analyses of organics diversion strategies.
SWOLF’s optimization capability will be used to perform the first dynamic multi-stage optimized LCA to assess the most cost-effective ways to sustainably manage organics in consideration of changing waste generation, composition, and policies through the following research objectives:
Develop projections for MSW generation and composition for next 30 years.
Develop projections of fuel and electricity costs and emissions under various GHG policy,renewable energy policy, and fuel price scenarios for next 30 years.
Finalize system-specific life-cycle process-models.
Use projections and process models in SWOLF to analyze the cost and environmental impacts associated with organics management strategies and policies."

Under the federal Research, Development, and Demonstration Program, liquid wastes can be directly landfilled, which serves as an effective moisture enhancement strategy towards in situ anaerobic waste treatment. Codisposal of solid and liquid waste can provide economic and environmental benefits to landfill owners. However, elevated moisture levels and biochemical compatibility of co-disposed wastes are concerns such that excessive leachate generation, leachate seeps, waste instability, and fugitive gas emissions do not adversely influence landfill operations. This project will focus on the effects of moisture enhancement strategies and the effects of co-disposing solid and liquid wastes on organic waste stabilization via three main objectives:
Analyze full-scale landfill data to (i) improve biogas generation modeling used to assess organic stability and (ii) evaluate the state-of-practice in solid and liquid waste co-disposal;
Evaluate the effects of moisture enhancement technique on biogas generation behavior; and
Evaluate the effects of solid and liquid waste co-disposal on biochemical compatibility.
Objective 1 will lead to improved landfill gas modeling to enhance comparisons with gas collection data used to assess organic waste stabilization and the duration of post-closure care. Objective 2 will lead to empirical tools to predict the lag-time between waste disposal and onset of biogas generation and rate of biogas generation as functions of moisture enhancement strategy (i.e., addition at the working face, “co-disposal,” versus liquid injection following disposal, “dosing”). Objective 3 will lead to guidance on biochemical compatibility of liquid and solid waste via development of decision tools for co-disposal operations. These deliverables are relevant to current practice have potential to transition landfilling to a more holistic operation where solid and liquid wastes are co-managed to enhance sustainability of waste management."

Some of these elevated temperature landfills have received industrial wastes that are known to release heat, but others have not. Some elevated temperature landfills are deeper and wetter than average, but others are not. Elevated temperatures have posed regulatory challenges, and in several cases have resulted in costly operations and management, pressure to initiate uncertain remedial actions, and litigation associated with off-site migration of gases and odors caused by elevated temperatures.
The objectives of this study are to ( i ) definitively and comprehensively understand and explain why some landfill temperatures become elevated and (ii) to develop and validate a methodology to predict temperatures within landfills, particularly elevated temperature conditions. We propose an approach that involves applied research in the three integrated areas:
Critical Analysis of Existing Information: Develop a comprehensive review and analysis of existing information that pertains to heat accumulation in landfills. This review will include literature data, analysis of elevated temperature landfill site characteristics, and a comprehensive review of data from landfills with atypical temperatures.
Mechanism Identification and Model Parameterization: Define the chemical reactions that contribute to excessive heat accumulation, with a focus on the temperature regime above which biological reactions contribute to heat. Develop a comprehensive knowledge base of the parameters used to describe these reactions as well as the parameters that control heat transport within landfills.
Formulation, Validation, and Calibration of Temperature Prediction Methodology: Develop a methodology to predict heat accumulation in landfills that is based on thermodynamic principles and accounts for all significant heat sources and sinks. Validate and calibrate the methodology using field data from elevated temperature landfills, and provide examples based on existing elevated temperature landfills that illustrate how the methodology can be used to predict elevated temperatures and/or evaluate remediation strategies.
At the completion of this project, landfill owners and operators will have a practical and validated methodology to predict heat accumulation in landfills. The methodology can then be used to develop practical best management practices that prevent excessive heat generation, and evaluate the feasibility of remediation strategies. We plan to collaborate with the EREF Project Stakeholder Group (PSG), and other industry experts throughout the study to ensure that the technical approach is informed by field experience. The findings will also be available to EREF and the PSG throughout the study via regularly scheduled webinars and stakeholder meetings as well as annual reports and journal articles."

The rule has been in place for more than five years and the Principal Investigators (PIs) recently completed an independent review and report on the manner in which the rule is working. Overall, the PIs concluded that the rule is working well and that all ten landfills that were visited are meeting criteria outlined in the OSR.
A general perspective shared by the landfill owners and operators interviewed is that the goals of the OSR currently coincide with the industry goals. The OSR provides a performance check on landfill operations, promotes increased gas generation and waste settlement, and provides a disposal alternative for commercial liquid, which can be added to sites with an active Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) permit. Most of the sites surveyed had an RD&D permit and disposal of commercial liquids represented a source of revenue and a means to increase waste moisture content and enhance organic waste decomposition.
The following recommendations were provided to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to ensure that the OSR continues to achieve the desired objectives while remaining easy to implement and practical.
WDNR should encourage US EPA to modify RCRA Subtitle D by incorporating the provisions in the current RD&D rule.
WDNR should develop guidelines regarding biochemical compatibility of liquid waste sources.
WDNR should clarify existing requirements for early and aggressive gas collection as part of organic stability plans and ensure that these requirements are followed for landfills adding liquid wastes.
WDNR should promote means to make beneficial use of landfill gas attractive.
WDNR should consider modification to the gas generation benchmarks in the OSR and development of a standardized gas analysis procedure.
WDNR should consider metrics for cessation of gas collection as part of the OSR.
WDNR should recognize that the OSR can affect publicly- and privately-owned landfills differently.
WDNR should recognize that gas generation alone does not address post-closure care and more comprehensive criteria are needed to address functional stability.
WDNR should consider a statewide life cycle analysis (LCA) to assess the effects of more aggressive organic waste diversion.
The objectives of this proposal are to (1) further develop the gas generation analysis and develop a uniform methodology for assessment of progress towards compliance with organic stability and (2) convert the report into an article suitable for publication in a journal with a focus on environmental policy. These objectives will allow recommendations to be developed on desirable changes to the OSR other related DNR rules, and/or national policy that ultimately will guide operational, construction, or design practices by MSW landfill owners and operators. Publication of the results in a journal will allow for dissemination of key findings related to organic waste stabilization to the global solid waste community.
As per stipulations in the OSR, landfill owners were required to analyze their gas collection data and assess whether the following benchmarks will be met in ≤ 40 yr post-closure (WDNR 2006): (i) monthly average gas (CH4 + CO2) production rate ≤ 5% of average maximum monthly gas production rate observed during the life of the facility, or ≤ 7.5ft3-gas/yd3-waste/yr; and (ii) cumulative gas (CH4 + CO2) yield ≥ 75% of projected total gas production. Meeting these benchmarks coincides with achieving organic stability as outlined by the WDNR. The PIs observed during the course of the evaluation that every owner was making this assessment using a different methodology. The first deliverable from this project will be a spreadsheet model that builds off the U.S. EPA LandGEM model (USEPA 2005) that owners can use to assess OSR compliance following a uniform methodology. The spreadsheet will be developed in Microsoft Excel and gas generation data from at least two of the landfills will be evaluated to ensure that the spreadsheet is useful and practical.
The analysis completed for the WDNR has nation-wide implications and dissemination of this information is important for the benefit of regulators and policy makers in other states that may be considering similar regulations. A central finding of the report was the importance of the RD&D rule, which allowed the goals of the OSR and landfill owners to largely overlap. A critical analysis of the rule could influence other states to allow for the addition of commercial liquids to landfills that would benefit both the state’s industry and landfill owners."

This project will develop solidification/stabilization (S/S) technology with Portland cement for the disposal of new baghouse coal fly ash and the co-disposal of fly ash and concentrated brines from the power industry. The relevance of this project to the Environmental Research & Education Foundation’s strategic research plan is as follows:
Develop effective S/S technology for waste pre-treatment of new baghouse fly ash and of concentrated flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) brines for landfill disposal.
Improve the effectiveness of S/S processes using coal fly ashand Portland cement for challenging fly ashes and waste brines of high metal and salt concentrations.
Improve the mechanistic understanding of heavy metal immobilization in S/S processes using fly ash and Portland cement.
It will greatly benefit the solid waste industry to gain understanding of the best practices to immobilize metals in these new forms of waste (new baghouse fly ash and concentrated brines) from the coal fired-power industry. The primary research objectives of the project are:
Determine the physicochemical characteristics of new baghouse fly ash;
Evaluate the immobilization of heavy metals in new baghouse fly ash by Portland cement;
Evaluate the immobilization of heavy metals and chloride in co-disposed fly ash and concentrated FGD brines;
Evaluate the impact of coal fly ash properties and brine chemistry on the S/S process and metal immobilization; and
Evaluate the predominant minerals formed in the S/S process and their stability."
