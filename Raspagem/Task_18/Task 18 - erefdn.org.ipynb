The bitumen replacement market is a potential repurposing for large quantities of waste plastics. It addresses an urgent economic and environmental need for plastic recycling as well as the transportation industry. With 4-5% replacement of bitumen, this market has the potential to consume 1 million tons of waste plastics out of the 26 million tons that go to landfills in the US. Also, the study goal is aligned with the global emphasis on enhancing transportation infrastructure sustainability. Moreover, asphalt pavements are 100% recyclable; therefore, plastic waste will remain in a recycling circular loop. Plastic waste, from landfill destined municipal solid waste (MSW), will be formulated for incorporation in bitumen that meets specified rheological and mechanical performance. Through manipulation of the chemical and molecular composition of waste plastics, current challenges, including sorting and processing of different plastics, storage instability and compatibility between bitumen and various plastics will be addressed.\\nThe objectives of this study are as follows:\\nDevelop compatibility and blending methodology of various plastic waste plastic for bitumen modification.\\nInvestigate the suitability of plastic types and mixed plastics for modifying bitumen.\\nDetermine the storage stability of plastic waste modified bitumen.\\nPerform chemical and rheological characterization of plastic-modified bitumen.\\nQuantify environmental benefits using life cycle assessment (LCA) for plastic-modified bitumen.\"\n",

For example, polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS) are now found in many landfills and cause great concerns to owners and operators. Supercritical water oxidation (SCWO) is game-changing treatment technology that could provide superior treatment with better economics. The Deshusses\\u2019 lab is leading the US with its new SCWO technology. It is well positioned to evaluate this technology at a technology readiness level (TRL7) leveraging past and existing funding. The objectives of this project are to demonstrate the technical and economic feasibility of using SCWO at landfills in the US.\\nSupporting objectives to reach these goals are to:\\nDemonstrate treatment of representative landfill leachates, condensates and concentrated liquids such as leachate reverse osmosis (RO) concentrate in our pilot 1 ton/day SCWO system with specific focus on PFAS and emerging contaminants.\\nConduct a detailed economic analysis of using SCWO at landfills at larger scale. This will include early assessment of scale and SCWO system throughout. If this assessment indicates that concentration of leachates and condensates (e.g., using reverse osmosis) followed by SCWO is the preferred route for treatment, the project will focus on treatment of concentrated liquids such as RO leachate concentrates.\\nExplore treatment synergies (e.g., hazardous wastes, PFAS contaminated sludge, selected organic wastes TBD with EREF) that may be co-treated with leachate/condensate or RO concentrates and that may affect the economic outcome.\"\n",

Conventional co-AD, in which two distinct waste streams are digested together (e.g., food waste and wastewater solids), generates methane gas (CH4). However, the low market value of CH4 ($160/ton) translates into a long return on initial capital investment and limits revenue generation that could help\\u00a0offset maintenance and operating costs. Shutting down the biological pathways to CH4 production in\\u00a0co-AD (via inhibition of methanogenesis) can result in the production of volatile fatty acids (VFAs) without compromising solids destruction goals. For example, research at NCSU has shown that increasing grease interceptor waste (GIW) loading beyond certain thresholds during co-AD with waste activated sludge can stop CH4 production and lead to generation of the VFAs acetic, propionic, butyric, and valeric acids. These VFAs have current market values in the range of $525 (acetic acid) to $6,000 (valeric\\u00a0acid) per ton and are therefore significantly more valuable than CH4.

In recent work supported by EREF, the researchers developed a model of heat accumulation in a landfill. The objective of the model was to help identify and mathematically describe all sources of heat input, generation and loss in a typical Subtitle D landfill. The model simulations identified several reactions that contribute significant heat to landfills including the hydration and carbonation of calcium-containing wastes (e.g., ash) and aluminum corrosion. Model predictions however, were based on information adopted from the literature for systems other than landfills. In addition to MSW, many landfills receive non-hazardous industrial wastes including ash from both coal and MSW combustion, ash used to solidify liquid wastes, auto shredder residue (ASR) that contains Al and Fe, and perhaps other Al-containing wastes. Methods are needed to measure the heat production potential of such wastes under landfill-relevant conditions and to use the resulting heat production data to evaluate the quantity of a given waste that can be disposed without the accumulation of unacceptable heat.\\nThe overall goal of the project is to estimate acceptable quantities of specific heat-producing wastes for disposal.

With more organic material collected from mixed waste streams there is the possibility for new \\u2013 unforeseen, unregulated and emergent \\u2013 risks to arise.\\nThe primary goal of this research is to identify the emergent risks associated with more cyclical food systems and to identify appropriate management procedures, policies and programs to reduce these risks. The objectives are:\\nTo screen for contamination of input organic wastes (commingled and sorted organics from various sources) from three states with different regulatory environments ranging from mandated separation of organics to completely voluntary/subscription-based separation.\\nTo survey a group of waste management practitioners and stakeholders to explore risk perceptions associated with various feedstocks and practices.\"\n",

Leachates from these types of waste contain cations at concentrations of a few orders of magnitude higher than\\u00a0typical MSW leachate and can significantly affect the performance of geosynthetic clay liners (GCLs). GCLs are hydraulic barrier systems that have a very low hydraulic conductivity to prevent contamination of the surrounding ground water. The aggressive characteristics (e.g. high total dissolved solids, such as K+, Na+, Mg2+ Ca2+ and NH4+ of the MSW-I landfill leachates may alter the bentonite fabric and lead to unacceptable increase in hydraulic conductivity. To resist these high ionic strength leachates, polymer-modified bentonites (PMBs) GCLs containing a blend of Na-B and various polymers have been introduced in recent years; these GCLs are referred to as second generation GCLs. The performance data and design criteria from the first generation GCLs cannot be directly applied to the second generation of GCLs, as the first generation of GCLs cannot manage the increased contaminants in the leachate. To date, only a limited number of studies have been performed on polymer modified GCLs, and the effects of the aggressive leachates on the performance and design of the second generation GCLs have not been well understood.\\nThe first objective of this study is to develop new alternative index tests, or criteria to predict the long-term hydraulic performance of the second generation GCLs. The second objective is to mechanistically understand how aggressive leachates like the MSW-I ash landfill leachate affect the performance of the second generation GCLs.

Landfill leachate increasingly requires pre-treatment because it contains high levels of refractory organic matter (ROM) and ammonia that could impact WWTP operations. ROM (i.e. humic- and fulvic-like substances) in leachate reduces the effectiveness of UV disinfection. As a result, WWTPs increasingly refuse to accept landfill leachate, pressuring landfill owners to explore costlier treatment alternatives.\\nThus, understanding the sources of ROM and exploration of alternatives to reduce its presence in leachates are needed. Concurrent with the difficulty in treating leachate in WWTPs, the diversion of food waste from landfills is increasing. This diversion is motivated by several factors including responses to policies banning food waste disposal, reducing landfill methane emissions, and more efficient recovery and utilization of methane from anaerobic digesters. As the composition of the waste stream changes, changes to leachate quality can be expected.\\nThe objectives of the study are:\\nTo determine the effect of removing food waste from municipal solid waste (MSW) on leachate quality during waste decomposition under simulated landfill conditions\\nTo characterize the compounds/moieties that absorb UV at 254 nm in samples of leachate produced in systems with and without food waste\\nIt is hypothesized that food waste diversion will result in reduced ammonia and ROM since food waste is readily degradable and more easily solubilized, when compared to other MSW organics.\"\n",

Some of these elevated temperature landfills have received industrial wastes that are known to release heat, but others have not. Some elevated temperature landfills are deeper and wetter than average, but others are not. Elevated temperatures have posed regulatory challenges, and in several cases have resulted in costly operations and management, pressure to initiate uncertain remedial actions, and litigation associated with off-site migration of gases and odors caused by elevated temperatures.\\nThe objectives of this study are to ( i ) definitively and comprehensively understand and explain why some landfill temperatures become elevated and (ii) to develop and validate a methodology to predict temperatures within landfills, particularly elevated temperature conditions. We propose an approach that involves applied research in the three integrated areas:\\nCritical Analysis of Existing Information: Develop a comprehensive review and analysis of existing information that pertains to heat accumulation in landfills. This review will include literature data, analysis of elevated temperature landfill site characteristics, and a comprehensive review of data from landfills with atypical temperatures.\\nMechanism Identification and Model Parameterization: Define the chemical reactions that contribute to excessive heat accumulation, with a focus on the temperature regime above which biological reactions contribute to heat. Develop a comprehensive knowledge base of the parameters used to describe these reactions as well as the parameters that control heat transport within landfills.\\nFormulation, Validation, and Calibration of Temperature Prediction Methodology: Develop a methodology to predict heat accumulation in landfills that is based on thermodynamic principles and accounts for all significant heat sources and sinks. Validate and calibrate the methodology using field data from elevated temperature landfills, and provide examples based on existing elevated temperature landfills that illustrate how the methodology can be used to predict elevated temperatures and/or evaluate remediation strategies.\\nAt the completion of this project, landfill owners and operators will have a practical and validated methodology to predict heat accumulation in landfills. The methodology can then be used to develop practical best management practices that prevent excessive heat generation, and evaluate the feasibility of remediation strategies. We plan to collaborate with the EREF Project Stakeholder Group (PSG), and other industry experts throughout the study to ensure that the technical approach is informed by field experience.

The rule has been in place for more than five years and the Principal Investigators (PIs) recently completed an independent review and report on the manner in which the rule is working. Overall, the PIs concluded that the rule is working well and that all ten landfills that were visited are meeting criteria outlined in the OSR.\\nA general perspective shared by the landfill owners and operators interviewed is that the goals of the OSR currently coincide with the industry goals. The OSR provides a performance check on landfill operations, promotes increased gas generation and waste settlement, and provides a disposal alternative for commercial liquid, which can be added to sites with an active Research, Development, and Demonstration (RD&D) permit. Most of the sites surveyed had an RD&D permit and disposal of commercial liquids represented a source of revenue and a means to increase waste moisture content and enhance organic waste decomposition.\\nThe following recommendations were provided to the Wisconsin Department of Natural Resources (WDNR) to ensure that the OSR continues to achieve the desired objectives while remaining easy to implement and practical.\\nWDNR should encourage US EPA to modify RCRA Subtitle D by incorporating the provisions in the current RD&D rule.\\nWDNR should develop guidelines regarding biochemical compatibility of liquid waste sources.\\nWDNR should clarify existing requirements for early and aggressive gas collection as part of organic stability plans and ensure that these requirements are followed for landfills adding liquid wastes.\\nWDNR should promote means to make beneficial use of landfill gas attractive.\\nWDNR should consider modification to the gas generation benchmarks in the OSR and development of a standardized gas analysis procedure.\\nWDNR should consider metrics for cessation of gas collection as part of the OSR.\\nWDNR should recognize that the OSR can affect publicly- and privately-owned landfills differently.\\nWDNR should recognize that gas generation alone does not address post-closure care and more comprehensive criteria are needed to address functional stability.\\nWDNR should consider a statewide life cycle analysis (LCA) to assess the effects of more aggressive organic waste diversion.\\nThe objectives of this proposal are to (1) further develop the gas generation analysis and develop a uniform methodology for assessment of progress towards compliance with organic stability and (2) convert the report into an article suitable for publication in a journal with a focus on environmental policy. These objectives will allow recommendations to be developed on desirable changes to the OSR other related DNR rules, and/or national policy that ultimately will guide operational, construction, or design practices by MSW landfill owners and operators. Publication of the results in a journal will allow for dissemination of key findings related to organic waste stabilization to the global solid waste community.\\nAs per stipulations in the OSR, landfill owners were required to analyze their gas collection data and assess whether the following benchmarks will be met in \\u2264 40 yr post-closure (WDNR 2006): (i) monthly average gas (CH4 + CO2) production rate \\u2264 5% of average maximum monthly gas production rate observed during the life of the facility, or \\u2264 7.5ft3-gas/yd3-waste/yr; and (ii) cumulative gas (CH4 + CO2) yield \\u2265 75% of projected total gas production. Meeting these benchmarks coincides with achieving organic stability as outlined by the WDNR. The PIs observed during the course of the evaluation that every owner was making this assessment using a different methodology. The first deliverable from this project will be a spreadsheet model that builds off the U.S. EPA LandGEM model (USEPA 2005) that owners can use to assess OSR compliance following a uniform methodology. The spreadsheet will be developed in Microsoft Excel and gas generation data from at least two of the landfills will be evaluated to ensure that the spreadsheet is useful and practical.\\nThe analysis completed for the WDNR has nation-wide implications and dissemination of this information is important for the benefit of regulators and policy makers in other states that may be considering similar regulations. A central finding of the report was the importance of the RD&D rule, which allowed the goals of the OSR and landfill owners to largely overlap. A critical analysis of the rule could influence other states to allow for the addition of commercial liquids to landfills that would benefit both the state\\u2019s industry and landfill owners.\"\n",

      "    \"descr_detalhada\": \"More stringent regulations to control heavy metals in flue gas emissions are expected to lead to new solid and liquid waste with higher heavy metal concentrations at coal-fired power plants. This project will develop solidification/stabilization (S/S) technology with Portland cement for the disposal of new baghouse coal fly ash and the co-disposal of fly ash and concentrated brines from the power industry. The relevance of this project to the Environmental Research & Education Foundation\\u2019s strategic research plan is as follows:\\nDevelop effective S/S technology for waste pre-treatment of new baghouse fly ash and of concentrated flue-gas-desulfurization (FGD) brines for landfill disposal.\\nImprove the effectiveness of S/S processes using coal fly ashand Portland cement for challenging fly ashes and waste brines of high metal and salt concentrations.\\nImprove the mechanistic understanding of heavy metal immobilization in S/S processes using fly ash and Portland cement.\\nIt will greatly benefit the solid waste industry to gain understanding of the best practices to immobilize metals in these new forms of waste (new baghouse fly ash and concentrated brines) from the coal fired-power industry. The primary research objectives of the project are:\\nDetermine the physicochemical characteristics of new baghouse fly ash;\\nEvaluate the immobilization of heavy metals in new baghouse fly ash by Portland cement;\\nEvaluate the immobilization of heavy metals and chloride in co-disposed fly ash and concentrated FGD brines;\\nEvaluate the impact of coal fly ash properties and brine chemistry on the S/S process and metal immobilization; and\\nEvaluate the predominant minerals formed in the S/S process and their stability.\"\n",
